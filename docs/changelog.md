# Sprint 1 release.
The main goal of this sprint was to migrate the entire application to a
structured way, that is ordering the source files, delete old code and
add a support for REST requests.

It has no visual changes (or not very perceptible) because the only work
was migrate the 960.gs grid system to Twitter Bootstrap grid system. This
was made thinking in a possible responsive design as the application grows
and changes.

It uses the Fat-Free Framework (written in PHP) for server requests.

# Version 1.0-alpha

* Use jQuery 1.7.2.
* Use jQuery UI 1.8.20.
* Use jqGrid for data display.
* Creation of database manager and database connector for MySQL databse.
